# CSS trading cards
These trading cards were built in CSS and HTML as an entry into an art contest. They're based off of the blockchain, DnD based, MMORPG, Mirandus. The characters on each of the cards are fun, active members of the Mirandus community.

Each of the trading cards includes a front and back view. This gives the viewer a more descriptive experience.

This project is viewable online via the website linked in my bio :)
